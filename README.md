# Version and Constraint Checking Library

go-version is a library for parsing versions, checking versions against
constraints or a list of constraints, etc. go-version helps components of
your app conform with semantic versioning (semver) if you have components,
by allowing semnatic versioning friendly constraints such as the
"pessimistic constraint operator:" ~> 1.2.3.
